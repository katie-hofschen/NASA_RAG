Editor’s note: This advisory was updated Feb. 22, 2024, to include a target launch date.

As part of NASA’s Commercial Crew Program, the agency opened media accreditation for the launch of NASA’s Boeing Crew Flight Test to the International Space Station. The mission will be the company’s first Starliner spacecraft mission with crew.

NASA astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams will launch aboard Starliner on a United Launch Alliance Atlas V rocket and dock at the orbiting laboratory, where they will stay for up to two weeks. Liftoff is currently targeted for no earlier than Monday, April 22 from Space Launch Complex-41 at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida.

The mission will test the end-to-end capabilities of the Starliner system, including launch, docking, and return to Earth in the desert of the western United States.

Following a successful mission, NASA will begin the final process of certifying Starliner and systems for crewed missions to the space station.

U.S. media may apply separately for a photo opportunity during the rollout of the Starliner spacecraft from Boeing’s Commercial Cargo and Processing Facility at NASA’s Kennedy Space Center in Florida. The operational activity is scheduled to take place in early April.

Media accreditation deadlines are as follows:

International media without U.S. citizenship interested in covering the launch must apply by 11:59 p.m., Thursday, March 14

U.S. media interested in a photo opportunity of Starliner rollout must apply by 11:59 p.m., Thursday, March 21

U.S. media interested in covering the launch must apply for credentials by 11:59 p.m., Sunday, April 7

NASA’s Commercial Crew Program is working with the American aerospace industry through a public-private partnership to launch astronauts on American rockets and spacecraft from American soil. The goal of the program is to provide safe, reliable, and cost-effective transportation on space station missions, which will allow for additional research time.
