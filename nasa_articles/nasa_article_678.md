Review of Drivers of Environmental Change Across Southeast Asia Published in Remote Sensing applications: Society and Environment 
 Pontus Olofsson (ST11) co-authored a paper titled “Review of drivers of forest degradation and deforestation in Southeast Asia.” The study, funded by a grant from the NASA Carbon Monitoring System awarded to Olofsson, presents a review of studies of drivers of forest degradation and deforestation in Southeast Asia. Attributions, including forest conversion to plantation, shifting cultivation, fire, logging, drought, and pest damage were reviewed.

The authors found that: (1) the major drivers are conversion of forest to plantation, shifting cultivation, logging, fire, and drought; (2) the numbers of studies vary greatly from country to country (Indonesia, for example, is much more studied than the Philippines); (3) knowledge about the different drivers is unequal; e.g. conversion of forest to plantation is more studied than other types of change; (4) fine resolution analyses of drivers in Southeast Asia are lacking in the literature; (5) the temporal dynamics of drivers remain largely unknown; and (6) attention to sampling-based estimation of accuracy and area needs improvement.
