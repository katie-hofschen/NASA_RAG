Making Ultra-fast Electron Measurements in Multiple Directions to Reveal the Secrets of the Aurora 
 The energetic electrons that drive the aurora borealis (the northern lights) have a rich and very dynamic structure that we currently do not fully understand. Much of what we know about these electrons comes from instruments that have fundamental limitations in their ability to sample multiple energies with high time resolution. To overcome these limitations, NASA is using an innovative approach to develop instrumentation that will enhance our measurement capabilities by more than an order of magnitudeâ€”revealing a wealth of new information about the amazing physics happening within the aurora.
