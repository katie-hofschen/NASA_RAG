Sols 4096-4097: Fun Math and a New Butte 
 Curiosity has been driving through an area surrounded by many buttes (for example, the Texoli butte). In todayâ€™s location a new butte came into view (see the image at the top of this blog post)! This butte, called "Wilkerson," is located across the Gediz Valley Ridge, so it has been obscured until now. We finally drove to a high enough location to see over the ridge, so Mastcam will capture the butte in a mosaic. Orbital images show that Wilkerson butte may have a mantling layer of unique rocks on top, so it will be interesting to see what it looks like from the ground.
