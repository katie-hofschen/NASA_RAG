How to Avoid Delayed Payment from the NSSC

We try very hard to ensure all payments arrive in a timely fashion. Occasionally, payments take longer to process than expected. Sometimes, invoices are returned to the vendor because they do not comply with the payment terms of the contract or problems processing the invoice delay payment. To facilitate processing of your invoice and to expedite your payment, we compiled the following list of reasons payments are delayed:

The invoice does not contain the following information per the Prompt Payment Act:

Vendor name

Contract/purchase order number

Date

Amount

Shipping and/or payment terms

Invoice number

Description of service/good invoiced

The invoice was not sent to the correct Designated Billing Office (DBO).

Check your contract/purchase order to ensure that the NSSC is the proper Designated Billing Office.

Check your contract/purchase order to ensure that the NSSC is the proper Designated Billing Office. Incorrect banking information for payment

Partial shipments or billings not stated in terms or conditions of contract

Submission of multiple invoices in one e-mail or fax

Encryption of email

Embedding multiple invoices or instructions and complicated attachments in e-mails

Invoice or file is not in a standard print format (Word, Excel or PDF)

Submission of documents as Microsoft Document Writer images and some TIFF applications

If your invoice form does not contain this information you may want to use the Standard Form (SF) 1034.

Submitting Proper Invoices to NASA

Make certain your invoice contains all the information stipulated in the Invoicing clause of your contract to avoid delays and expedite the payment process. Generally, each Invoicing clause requires the following:

Name and Address

Invoice Date/Number

Contract/Purchase Order Number

Description of Goods or Services (CLIN, QTY, U/P), Quantity, Unit Price, Total Amount of Invoice

Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) (if applicable)

All vouchers for cost reimbursable contracts have to be submitted through IPP.

Before you submit your invoice for payment, please check each contract/purchase order to see where invoices for each contract/purchase order are to be submitted.

System for Award Management (SAM) for NASA Vendors

System for Award Management (SAM) for NASA Vendors

Payments against NASA contracts and other procurement actions are made by the NSSC. In order to better align with Federal-wide vendor databases, NASA uses the System for Award Management (SAM) to validate vendor information across all of the Agency’s Integrated Enterprise Management (IEM) business systems. NASA payments to vendors are processed using the banking information in SAM.

To ensure continued accurate and prompt payments, please maintain a current registration, including banking information in SAM. SAM can be accessed at www.sam.gov.

If you need assistance registering or have questions about SAM, contact the SAM Help Desk at www.fsd.gov.

NASA will use the clause at FAR 52.232-33 in contracts as the default Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) requirement.

Please note that any information provided in your registration may be shared with authorized federal government offices. Registration does not guarantee business with the federal government.
