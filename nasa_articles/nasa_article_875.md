Bright Rocks on the Horizon: An Exciting Glimpse of Uncharted Territory 
 Based on orbital satellite images, rock layers near the Jezero Crater Rim are thought to be among the oldest rocks that could be explored by a rover on Mars. Therefore, the light-toned rock layers pictured here could represent much older strata than has yet been explored by Perseverance – possibly dating back to the Noachian (approximately 3.7 – 4.1 billion years ago). Exploration of these terrains could provide unprecedented insight into the climate and environmental habitability during earlier and possibly wetter periods in Mars’ history.
