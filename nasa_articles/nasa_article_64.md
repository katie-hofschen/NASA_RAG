NASA is awarding approximately $45 million to 21 higher-education institutions to help build capacity for research. The awards were made possible through the Minority University Research and Education Project Institutional Research Opportunity (MIRO) and Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR) grants, which are funded by the agency’s Office of Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) Engagement.

“NASA’s Minority University Research and Education Project Institutional Research Opportunity and Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research awards help institutions raise their technological bar,” said Torry Johnson, deputy associate administrator of STEM Engagement Programs at NASA Headquarters in Washington. “When institutions enhance their capabilities and infrastructure, they become more competitive in their research, which opens doors to valuable experience and opportunities.”

Minority University Research and Education Project Institutional Research Opportunity (MIRO) Awards

Seven minority-serving institutions will receive approximately $5 million each over a five-year period of performance for projects that span a variety of research topics. The institutions and their proposed projects are:

Alaska Pacific University in Anchorage – Alaska Pacific University Microplastics Research and Education Center

– Alaska Pacific University Microplastics Research and Education Center California State University in Fullerton – SpaceIgnite Center for Advanced Research-Education in Combustion

– SpaceIgnite Center for Advanced Research-Education in Combustion City University of New York, Hunter College in New York – NASA-Hunter College Center for Advanced Energy Storage for Space

– NASA-Hunter College Center for Advanced Energy Storage for Space Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University in Tallahassee – Integrative Space Additive Manufacturing: Opportunities for Workforce-Development in NASA Related Materials Research and Education

– Integrative Space Additive Manufacturing: Opportunities for Workforce-Development in NASA Related Materials Research and Education New Jersey Institute of Technology in Newark – AI Powered Solar Eruption Center of Excellence in Research and Education

– NASA MIRO Inflatable Deployable Environment and Adaptive Space Systems Center University of Illinois in Chicago – Center for In-Space Manufacturing: Recycling and Regolith Processing

NASA’s MIRO award was established to strengthen and develop research capacity and infrastructure of minority serving institutions in areas of strategic importance and value to NASA missions and national priorities.

Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR) Award

NASA establishes partnerships with government, higher education, and industry to create lasting improvements in research infrastructure and capacity for specific states or regions, while enhancing its national research and development competitiveness. The program is directed at those jurisdictions that have traditionally not participated in competitive aerospace and aerospace-related research activities.

NASA will award 14 institutions up to $750,000 each over the course of a three-year period of performance. The awarded institutions and their projects are:
