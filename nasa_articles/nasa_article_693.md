Challenge Theme

Responding to Natural Disasters with New Aviation

A natural disaster is a type of severe weather with the potential to pose significant threat to human health and safety. Natural disasters, especially wildfires, affect everyone around the world. Some are affected directly and others indirectly. NASA’s Advanced Capabilities for Emergency Response Operations (ACERO) project is helping to improve wildfire coordination and operations using drones and advanced technologies. Wildfires are not the only natural disasters that affect human life, animal life, and the environment. Learn more about NASA’s ACERO project.

NASAs Advanced Air Mobility mission focuses on, in part, the drone technology needed to gather data about how these automated aircraft can help air travel be more accessible, safe, and affordable. Smaller aircraft such as cargo-carrying drones and passenger-carrying air taxis will have the capability to serve hard-to-reach urban and rural locations. The ACERO project researches the use of this technology to help with preventing a natural disaster, mitigating during a natural disaster situation, and rebuilding after a natural disaster has occurred.

The 2024 Dream with Us design challenge is asking for your help with ideas that will be shared with NASA’s ACERO project and others to design or improve current systems and technologies responding to natural disasters with new aviation such as drones and air taxis. Designs and improvements will focus on these areas:

(1) help reduce natural disaster risks

(2) help mitigate the situation during a natural disaster, and/or

(3) help rebuild after a natural disaster has occurred.

Drone technology can have hundreds of uses and we want you to dream of ways they can help with natural disasters. Since these new technologies will affect future generations, part of the challenge asks you to tell younger audiences why your drone’s work is important to them.

Challenge Description

Students ages 13 – 18 are invited to join with NASA Aeronautics and help us improve the ways we help with natural disasters by adding new aviation capabilities. Put together your dream team of 2 – 4 teammates and create a new design or improve current capabilities of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to:

prevent risks that cause natural disasters

mitigate the situation during a disaster and/or

rebuild after a natural disaster has occurred

and create a campaign that shows elementary-aged kids why this is important.

Build a presentation for a team of NASA experts that explains how your drone helps in one or all three of these areas. Create a campaign that teaches kids about this disaster and the work of your UAV.

You will have access to STEM activities and resources that can be used to help your team create your project. Winning teams and their school will get the chance to meet a NASA expert to share how they contribute to current aeronautics challenges. Winning designs may also be shared on our social media platforms and more.

Ages

For students ages 13 – 18.

Project submission A is for teams of students ages 13 – 15. Project submission B is for teams of students ages 16 – 18 (for teams with multiple ages, the submission category will be based on the oldest member of the team). STEM activities for grades K – 12 will be available regardless of design challenge participation.

Dates

Submissions accepted March 1 – April 30, 2024. Submission link: https://stemgateway.nasa.gov/s/course-offering/a0B3d000001k6Zj/. Winners will first be announced during a virtual awards reception (TBD) then shared on social media and the Dream with Us design challenge webpage after the reception.

Challenge Topic Descriptions

Types of Natural Disasters

A natural disaster is a type of severe weather with the potential to pose significant threat to human health and safety.

Floods Condition that occurs when water overflows over its natural or artificial barriers and accumulates over low-lying areas https://www.earthdata.nasa.gov/topics/terrestrial-hydrosphere/surface-water/surface-water-processes-measurements/floods

Wildfires Unplanned and uncontrolled fires that spread rapidly and can be disastrous. Under control, wildfires can be essential to the ecosystem. https://appliedsciences.nasa.gov/what-we-do/wildfires

Earthquakes An intense shaking of Earth’s surface caused by movements of the Earth’s outermost layer. https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/earthquakes/en/

Volcanoes An opening on the surface of a planet or moon that allows material warmer than its surroundings to escape causing an eruption. https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/volcanoes2/en/

Landslides Heavy rainfall and flooding washes away the ground of rock, debris, and earth down a steep slope causing the earth to cover everything in its path. https://www.earthdata.nasa.gov/learn/toolkits/disasters-toolkit/landslides-toolkit

Tornadoes Form from severe thunderstorms leading to a clash between moist, warm air and cold, dry air and develop extremely strong horizontal winds that swirl around their center. https://gpm.nasa.gov/resources/faq/what-difference-between-tornado-and-hurricane

Hurricanes (aka typhoons or cyclones) Large scale storms with extremely strong horizontal winds that swirl around their center that form over warm waters near the equator. https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/hurricanes/en/

Extreme heat Heat wave is a period of unusually (historically) hot weather that lasts more than two days. https://scijinks.gov/heat/

Extreme cold Snowstorms are frozen precipitation that falls in the form of snow in large, heavy quantities. https://espo.nasa.gov/impacts/content/IMPACTS

Etc. (others that directly affect the entrant)

Types of Drones or Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs)

A drone is an uncrewed/unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) used to perform jobs with a drone pilot using a remote control or autonomously, without a pilot or a remote control. Small drones can be used for observation, mapping, or package delivery, while larger air taxis will have the capability to transport people. Uncrewed/unmanned aircraft systems is the term that emphasizes drones as a system. Click on this link for more information about uncrewed/unmanned aircraft systems.https://ntrs.nasa.gov/api/citations/20170011510/downloads/20170011510.pdf

Multicopters Small UAV that uses multiple propellers to fly. Using Newton’s 3 rd law: the propellers action pushes air downward causing an upward force (lift) reaction against gravity causing the quadcopter to move up. The number of propellers names the copter: 4 propellers = Quadcopter, 6 propellers = Hexacopter, and so on. https://www.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/aam-science-behind-quadcopters-reader-student-guide_0.pdf?emrc=8caa02

Rotorcraft Autonomous aircraft that uses one or more rotary wing to generate lift. https://www.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/uas-appendix.pdf?emrc=60b6fb

Sm/Med/Lg Fixed Wing Familiar 3-segment design with longer endurance than VTOL UAVs. https://technology.nasa.gov/patent/LAR-TOPS-293

Air taxi Large autonomous aircraft that can carry people relatively short distances https://www.nasa.gov/centers-and-facilities/armstrong/nasa-studies-human-pilots-to-advance-autonomous-air-taxis/

Vertical Take-Off and Landing (VTOL) Autonomous vehicles used to carry people that rely on vertical take-off and landing capabilities. https://www.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/aam-air-taxi-design-challenge-educator-guide_0.pdf?emrc=c0b9bf
