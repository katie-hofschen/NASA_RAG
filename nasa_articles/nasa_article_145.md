Asian-American and Native Hawaiian Pacific Islander Heritage Month 
 In honor of Asian-American and Native Hawaiian Pacific Islander Heritage Month, we recognize astronauts with Asian roots who have flown to the International Space Station and contributed to its assembly, operations and research activities. Other pioneers preceded them into space. The first person of Asian origin to reach space, Phạm Tuân of Vietnam spent eight days aboard the Salyut-6 space station in 1980 as part of the Soviet Union’s Interkosmos program to fly cosmonauts from friendly socialist countries. The first American of Asian descent in space, Ellison S. Onizuka, flew as a mission specialist aboard space shuttle Discovery’s STS-51C mission in 1985. He tragically lost his life in the January 1986 space shuttle Challenger accident.

In this article, we recognize the American astronauts of Asian, Native Hawaiian, and Pacific Island heritage and astronauts from Asian nations who have flown aboard the space station, contributing to its construction and operation and conducting the world-class research for which the station is well known. The table below lists these individuals who have shared in this remarkable international adventure. Asian-American astronauts from recent selections await their chance to contribute to the success of the space station and to future exploration missions.



Table of Asian and Asian-American astronauts and cosmonauts who have lived and worked aboard the International Space Station

Edward T. Lu

NASA astronaut Edward T. “Ed” Lu holds the honor as the first Asian-American to fly to the International Space Station. Already a veteran of STS-84, the sixth shuttle docking mission to the Russian space station Mir, Lu served as a Mission Specialist on STS-106. He and his six crewmates launched on Sep. 8, 2000, with the primary goal of preparing the station for its first long-duration occupants. At the time, the station comprised just three modules – the Zarya Functional Cargo Block, the Unity Node 1, and the Zvezda Service Module. Zvezda, the latest addition to the station, had just arrived two months earlier. At the station, the crew’s duties included unloading a Progress resupply craft of its cargo and transferring logistics from the double Spacehab module in Atlantis’ payload bay. Lu and crewmate Russian cosmonaut Yuri I. Malenchenko conducted a six-hour spacewalk to connect electrical cables between the Zarya and Zvezda modules and to install a boom magnetometer on the outside of Zvezda.

Lu returned to the space station in 2003, this time as Expedition 7 flight engineer, with his STS-106 crewmate Malenchenko as his commander. They launched on April 26 aboard Soyuz TMA2, the first two-person long-duration crew following the Columbia accident. The station had grown significantly since their last visit, with the addition of the Destiny U.S. laboratory module, the Canadarm2 robotic manipulator, the Quest airlock, a pair of large solar arrays, and two truss segments. In tribute to his home state of Hawaii, Lu enjoyed wearing colorful Aloha shirts and used Hawaiian musical instruments called pu’ili sticks for an educational demonstration. Aware of his penchant for the colorful Hawaiian shirts, personnel in the Mission Control Center at NASA’s Johnson Space Center in Houston all wore them to remotely celebrate Lu’s 40th birthday in July. Lu and Malenchenko returned to Earth in October 2003 after spending 185 days in space.

Leroy Chiao

By the time NASA astronaut Leroy Chiao made his first visit to the space station, he had already flown two space shuttle missions, STS-65 and STS-72. During STS-92, he and his crewmates continued to prepare the station for its first occupants. Launching aboard Discovery on Oct. 11, 2000, they docked with the station two days later and began their assembly tasks. Chiao participated in two of the mission’s four spacewalks with crewmate NASA astronaut William S. McArthur to install the Z1 truss segment, the Space-to-Ground Antenna, Control Moment Gyros, and the third Pressurized Mating Adapter, spending more than 13 hours outside.

For his second visit to the space station, Chiao went to stay, as commander of Expedition 10. He and his crewmate, Russian cosmonaut Salizhan S. Sharipov, originally from Kyrgyzstan, launched aboard Soyuz TMA-5 on Oct. 14, 2004. The two conducted maintenance on the station and performed a pair of spacewalks. Part of Chiao’s research program involved ultrasound studies in microgravity. As a first, he submitted the results of the experiment to a scientific journal from the space station. Chiao and Sharipov landed back on Earth in April 2005 after 193 days in space.

Next up for Tani involved a long-term visit to the space station, as a member of Expedition 16. He launched as part of the STS-120 crew on Oct. 23, 2007, the flight of Discovery that brought the Harmony Node 2 module to the station. A critical element, Node 2 served as a hub for the addition of the European and Japanese research modules. With Discovery still docked to the station, Tani conducted one spacewalk with fellow NASA astronaut Scott E. Parazynski to disconnect the P6 truss segment from its Z1 location prior to its robotic relocation to the main station truss. After joining the Expedition 16 crew, and having exchanged places with NASA astronaut Clayton C. Anderson, Tani performed five spacewalks with station commander NASA astronaut Peggy A. Whitson to finish the installation of the Harmony module. Swapping places with ESA astronaut Léopold P. Eyharts, Tani returned to Earth in February 2008 during the STS-122 mission of Atlantis, the flight that brought the European Columbus research module to the orbiting laboratory. His efforts helped to greatly enlarge the station’s capabilities. During his two flights, Tani spent 132 days in space and 39 hours on spacewalks.

Sunita L. Williams

As noted above, NASA astronaut Suni Williams arrived at the space station with STS-116 in December 2006 during one of the busiest and most complex periods of assembly. In addition to the arrival of new truss segments, the astronauts reconfigured the station’s power system. While still a Shuttle crewmember, Williams participated in one of the spacewalks with fellow NASA astronaut Robert L. Curbeam as part of the power reconfiguration. She joined the Expedition 14 crew, replacing ESA astronaut Reiter. With Expedition 14 commander NASA astronaut Michael E. López-Alegría she performed three more spacewalks to complete the activation of the station’s ammonia cooling system. In April 2007, during her transition to the Expedition 15 crew, Williams “ran” the Boston Marathon on the station’s treadmill, wearing number 14000 and finishing in 4 hours 24 minutes. She exchanged places with NASA astronaut Anderson during the STS-117 mission that delivered the S3/S4 truss and a new pair of solar arrays to the station. Williams returned to Earth after 191 days in space, at the time the longest single spaceflight by a woman. The more than 29 hours she spent outside on her four spacewalks also set a record for women.

Kjell N. Lindgren

NASA astronaut Kjell N. Lindgren’s first flight into space began on July 22, 2015, with a launch aboard Soyuz TMA-17M with Russian veteran cosmonaut Oleg D. Kononenko and first-time flyer JAXA astronaut Kimiya Yui. They joined the Expedition 44 crew. Lindgren began a busy research program that among other experiments included the growing of lettuce in the Vegetable Production System, also known as Veggie, apparatus. As a bonus, the scientists allowed the crew members to taste the lettuce, first plain and then with oil and vinegar, prior to freezing the remaining plants for analysis back on Earth. A new crew arrived in September, including Kazakh cosmonaut Aidyn A. Aimbetov making a short visit to the station. Lindgren performed two spacewalks with fellow NASA astronaut Scott J. Kelly, spending 15 hours outside performing upgrades and maintenance on the station. Lindgren returned to Earth in December after spending 142 days in space.
