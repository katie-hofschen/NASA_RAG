Earn Awards for Doing NASA Science with GLOBE Observer 
 On March 6, 2024, the GLOBE Observer team released a new way to appreciate and celebrate volunteer contributions: My Achievements! This new section of the GLOBE Observer app helps volunteers keep track of their contributions to GLOBE and shows milestone badges and streaks for all data that volunteers have submitted to GLOBE (since 1995). The awards can be found under “My Achievements”, accessible from the GLOBE Observer home screen. Milestone badges are awarded at intervals of 1-5-10-25-50-75-100-150-200-250-300-400+, and volunteers receive a thank-you email when they receive a milestone badge. Volunteers can also earn “streaks” by making observations for two or more days in a row.
