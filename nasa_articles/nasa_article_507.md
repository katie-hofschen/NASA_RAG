Sols 4127-4130: Backstage: Quick Change! 
 On the first 2 sols of this plan, prior to driving away, APXS will take measurements on the shallow drill attempt at ‘Mineral King 3,’ as there are some drill tailings present. ChemCam has packed the plan with activities including the final LIBS observations in this workspace on some nodular rocks of interest ‘Wishorn Reservoir’ and ‘Diamond Mesa.’ ChemCam will then take an RMI mosaic of a sand trough named ‘Centre Basin’ near the rover, as well as two long distance RMI mosaics of ‘Texoli,’ and ‘Dragtooth’ buttes. Mastcam will take the standard documentation images on the ChemCam LIBS observations, as well as a final change detection image of ‘Florence Peak,’ a sand ripple in the workspace we have been monitoring for a few weeks to see how much it moves over time. Mastcam also have some larger mosaics planned including extensions of previously imaged areas including the drilling location ‘Mineral King,’ as well as targets ‘Consultation Lake’ and ‘Cottonwood Pass.’ During this plan we also have a range of environmental monitoring activities: Mastcam will be used for a sky survey, and Navcam will be searching for dust devils and will be used to take a suprahorizon movie.
