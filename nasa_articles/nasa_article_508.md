Sols 4130-4131: A Return to Your Regularly Scheduled Touch-And-Go 
 While not getting quite as close as MAHLI and APXS, Mastcam and ChemCam are also taking advantage of the workspace with LIBS on "Ireland Lake" (appropriately named for the day after St Patrick's Day!), a ChemCam mosaic of "Fascination Turret," and Mastcam mosaics of the upper Gediz Vallis Ridge and "Koontz Pinnacle." On the ENV side, we're rounding out the sol with an image of the rover deck to track any potential movement from wind, and a couple of observations to monitor the decreasing dust. Then it's time to go â€“ off towards Fascination Turret.
