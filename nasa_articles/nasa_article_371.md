Sols 4141-4143: An Intriguing Mess 
 Today’s 3-sol plan is focused on contact science on the bedrock in our workspace, remote sensing to understand our surroundings, and a short bump to prepare for contact science at Hinman Col next week. Before we get to Hinman Col, we have another opportunity to assess the light-toned, laminated bedrock in our workspace. The science team planned 3 contact science targets, including DRT, MAHLI, and APXS on the target “Rose Lake” to assess the chemistry and textures in typical bedrock. We also planned a MAHLI stereo mosaic on “Whorl Mountain” to model the rock surface and study bedding orientations around some disrupted laminations, and another MAHLI/APXS target called “Little Slide Canyon” to investigate the texture and composition of the more convoluted bedding.
