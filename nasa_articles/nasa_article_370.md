Sols 4144-4145: ‘Fools on the Hill’ 
 We start off this two-sol plan with an early arm backbone for APXS to take measurements as cold as possible on a rubbly rock target named “Bodie.” ChemCam also prefers cooler temperatures for data quality and instrument performance, so after APXS is done the arm is placed out of the way for ChemCam to shoot their laser on another workspace block named “Crystal Crag.” Mastcam likes to take advantage of noon-ish lighting, and follows with over 170 images of the terrain in about 45 minutes. By this time, the sun is in a good spot for MAHLI lighting during their 25 cm and 5 cm stereo images of Bodie. And then, before even taking a nap, we are driving away from Hinman Col and into the next phase of our adventure.
