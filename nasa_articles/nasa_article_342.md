DoD-NASA Lidar TIM

August 14-16, 2024

MIT Lincoln Laboratory in Arlington, VA (Crystal City)

241 18th St S, Arlington, VA 22202

MIT Lincoln Laboratory is hosting a TIM between NASA and DoD to facilitate the sharing of lidar knowledge between these institutions and identify potential areas of collaboration that maximally utilizes the strengths from each organization. This TIM will provide an opportunity to discuss common issues and challenges and possible solutions.

Objectives

This TIM will include up to CUI-level presentations and discussions from leaders in lidar technology development and application.

Share DoD & NASA capabilities in lidar systems, technologies, processing and exploitation/analysis with DoD community & NASA centers, including JPL and NASA headquarters. Identify NASA and DoD mission and sensor needs that could leverage existing lidar investments to satisfy requirements. Connect NASA and DoD lidar practitioners, experts and end-user communities and Define at least two potential applications for collaborative opportunity.

Co-Chairs

M. Jalal Khan (MIT-LL), T.Y. Fan (MIT-LL), Jessica Gaskin (NESC), Upendra Singh (NESC), Haris Riris (ESTO – HQ) and Parminder Ghuman (ESTO – HQ)

More information

The event will kick off with invited speakers from NASA and DoD who will speak generally to the mission requirements of their respective communities and challenges and opportunities for lidar systems and related technologies to meet these needs.

The 2.5-day working meeting is broadly organized into 4 topic area sessions for which briefings are being solicited. Following the briefs, significant time will be dedicated for breakout to discuss and identify collaborative opportunities that could meet current and future community needs. The breakout team will brief the output of their discussion on Day 3.

The four topic session areas: Lidar Systems Lidar Transmitter Technologies (laser, photonics, optics, waveforms, etc.) Lidar Receive Technologies (optics, detectors, ROICs, etc.) Processing and Analysis (architectures, algorithms, AI/ML, embedded hardware)



Note to speakers:

The goals of these talks are to inform others with a variety of lidar backgrounds, encourage discussion and interactions, and drive potential solutions. To these ends we suggest the following should be addressed in your talk: (1) the basic concept, (2) current status, (3) challenges, (4) critical gap areas, and (5) future direction(s).
