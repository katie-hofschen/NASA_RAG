NASA Science at National Camp Conference 
 Several of the NASA Science Activation Program's project teams shared a variety of Earth and space activities and resources with camps at the American Camp Association’s national conference in New Orleans in February, 2024. In a session on space art for camps, staff used chalk art to predict the Sun’s corona, made bubble renderings of the Moon’s cratered surface, designed sundials and aurora bracelets, and deciphered space photos and their own color art with filters. In another session, camp staff worked through a mindfulness approach to exploring nature with their senses, encouraging campers to use their observation skills while taking the time to develop a deeper understanding of the different parts that make up our Earth as a system. At a booth, NASA distributed posters and glasses for the upcoming eclipse, information about Earth science activities for camps, and a variety of other resources from NASA's Science Activation program.
