Harsh, low-angle sunlight, long and dark shadows, and a featureless terrain will make navigation difficult when NASAâ€™s ISRU Pilot Excavator (IPEx) is sent to the Moon. Because of this, the IPEx team has begun testing various approaches to autonomously drive the excavator in a specially constructed rock yard that mimics these environmental conditions. The team plans to publish the data sets from these unique tests later this year.
