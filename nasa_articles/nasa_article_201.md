NASA was recognized today by the 28th Annual Webby Awards with six Webby Awards and eight Webby People’s Voice Awards, the latter of which are awarded by the voting public. The Webbys honors excellence in nine major media types: websites and mobile sites, video, advertising, media and public relations, apps and software, social media, podcasts, games, the metaverse, and virtual and artificial intelligence (AI).

“We’re thrilled that the Webbys have recognized the breadth of NASA’s digital communications,” said Marc Etkind, associate administrator for communications. “To have a podcast, a virtual exhibit, live streaming, social and web all honored shows how skilled and accomplished our team is. We’re especially pleased to see awards recognizing our reinvigorated digital platforms, including the NASA website and NASA+ streaming service. Together with the science website and NASA app, they are the core of our digital communications.”

The broad scope of the awards also highlights the agency’s enterprise approach to communications. For example, live streams are produced and led by the Office of Communications at NASA Headquarters in Washington. Each program, however, originates from within projects at NASA centers and represents many months of logistical preparation, rehearsals and constant review and adjustment. Once the TV streams are set, they are hosted on NASA’s website and fed to NASA’s social media channels, where the agency team engages with the live audience, providing background context and answering questions. All the while, agency photographers are documenting the effort and posting pictures to digital platforms while NASA’s audio team is gather sound and interviews to continue telling the story via podcasts.

Since 1998, NASA has been nominated for more than 100 Webby Awards, winning 37 Webbys and 53 People’s Voice Awards.
