Sols 4098-4099: With Love From Mars 
 One of these is our contact science target, "Horseshoe Meadows," a section of bedrock (which you can see in the image, right above where "Curiosity" is written) that is redder than what we’ve been seeing recently. After APXS takes a look, we move into our main science block which starts with ChemCam LIBs on a different bedrock target, "Post Corral Creek." ChemCam will then set its sights further afield to a familiar target, Fascination Turret, which Mastcam examined on Monday. Mastcam gets its own treats today, starting with two mosaics of the upper Gediz Vallis Ridge and an old friend, the Orinoco Butte, which has been a regular companion of Curiosity for many, many sols. Mastcam will also join ChemCam in imaging "Post Corral Creek." The science block finishes up with a deck monitoring image. We’ve been taking these recently before and after every drive to see how the dust that collects on the rover deck changes because of things like driving or wind. After the science block, we return to Horseshoe Meadows with the DRT and MAHLI, and then it’s time to bid farewell to this workspace and drive away.
