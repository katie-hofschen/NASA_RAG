Four STEM Enhancement in Earth Science Interns Conduct Research in Microgravity 
 The opportunity for these students to fly was made possible by the SEES program and its partnership with Space for Teachers, Wisconsin Space Grant Consortium, the International Space Station National Laboratory, and the Zero Gravity Corporation, which provide opportunities for middle and high-school teachers to develop and fly small experiments and demonstrations on a parabolic flight. Parabolic flights provide periods of sustained microgravity for testing spaceflight technologies, training astronauts, and performing experiments. This opportunity is funded by the NASA Flight Opportunities Program and by the International Space Station National Laboratory (CASIS).
