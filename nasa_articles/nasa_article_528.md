Sols 4125-4126: Woohoo! We’re ‘Go’ for Drilling At ‘Mineral King 3!’ 
 For those not following along every day, here’s a quick recap of how we got to drill target #3 on this block: We drilled the original “Mineral King” target on sol 4107, but the drill did not reach as deep into the rock as it usually does, so we didn’t know how much powdered sample we’d collected for analysis. We learned the answer was we had enough sample for CheMin analysis, but not for SAM. We decided to try to drill again to collect more sample, so we picked a spot named “Mineral King 2” on the same block. Alas! After we attempted to preload the drill, we found out that the Mineral King 2 spot would not be a good location to try to drill. So, on Monday, we picked another location, now up to Mineral King 3, and tried the drill preload again. We found out this morning that our preload data are looking good, so we are “go” to plan for a full drill of Mineral King 3 in today’s plan!
