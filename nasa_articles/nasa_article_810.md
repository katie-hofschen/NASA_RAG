Native Sky Solar Eclipse Professional Development - NASA Science 
 During this PD, the NENS team hosted 110 K-12 teachers and administrators at Oklahoma State University-Stillwater. The educators learned about NENS, heard an overview of eclipse science, and then spent the second half of the event receiving and learning resources on how to teach the eclipse to their students and safely experience it with them. A major highlight of the PD was splitting the educators into groups and modeling the Earth/Sun/Moon relationship during an eclipse. During this portion of the day, teachers received lesson slides and many other resources to use at their own schools. Thanks to NASA, each educator that attended the PD left with a class-set of eclipse viewing glasses. They also received two books for each classroom as well: "A Few Beautiful Minutes" by Kate Allen Fox and "Totality! An Eclipse Guide in Rhyme and Science" by Jeffrey Bennett.
