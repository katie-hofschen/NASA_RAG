Former STEM Enhancement in Earth Science Interns Receive Prestigious Awards 
 The STEM Enhancement in Earth Science (SEES) Summer Intern Program is a nationally competitive STEM program for high school students. The program provides selected students with exposure to Earth and Space research. Interns learn how to interpret NASA satellite data while working with scientists and engineers in their chosen area of work. This content knowledge, coupled with hands-on experiences, allows the intern to gain experience in authentic NASA research through field investigation and data analysis. Several former SEES Interns were recognized in January, 2024, for their incredible accomplishments.
