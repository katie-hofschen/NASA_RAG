Sols 4139-4140: Continuing up the Channel 
 We're rapidly nearing the peak of the dusty season, so the environmental science team's observations are very dust-focused. We begin by using Navcam to take some images of the northern crater rim to observe the amount of dust between the rover and the rim. As can be seen in the above image, we've got quite a bit of dust in the air at the moment. You really have to squint to just barely make out the crater rim! We'll then take some "deck monitoring" image to see how the wind and the rover's motion as it drives affects the sand that has gathered on top of the rover deck since landing. After that, we'll survey the area around us for dust devils and take a "Suprahorizon Movie." The Suprahorizon Movie is usually used to look for clouds over Gale, but we've adjusted the direction that it points to look over a large sand patch that we drove past about 260 sols ago so that it can pull double-duty to hunt for wind-driven sand lifting or dust devils in addition to clouds.
