Sols 4073-4075: A Fractured Filled Plan 
 First we will focus on the large block at the front of the workspace. APXS will examine the brushed bedrock target “Mount Langley,” an area without any obvious fractures on the top of the slab to determine the bulk chemistry of the rocks in this area. Then we look at fracture fill in “Sleeping Beauty's Tower” in one of the sub-vertical parallel lines or fractures (crosscutting the horizontal layers) along the side of the large block. In addition to the typical MAHLI imaging of a science target, the MAHLI team opted to add frames around this target, giving even more topographic information. ChemCam will use LIBS to look at “Moraine Lake,” an area of polygonal features on the top of the block, and Mastcam will image the whole block. ChemCam will also use LIBS on “Penstemon,” a rather gnarly looking smaller block in the workspace, and take a passive raster on layering at “Vidette Meadow.”
