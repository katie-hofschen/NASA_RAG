Sols 4084-4085: A Drive With a View 
 Today I served as the Geology Keeper of the Plan where I recorded all the details of the science activities that were proposed by science and instrument team members. We kicked off planning for sol 4084 by analyzing a finely layered rock named "Grizzly Lakes" with the dust removal tool (DRT), APXS, and MAHLI imaging. Just beyond "Grizzly Lakes," ChemCam and Mastcam teamed up to characterize a crescent-shaped rock, "Gorge of Despair," to investigate flakey dark material standing in relief on the surface of the rock. The Mastcam team created a mosaic of the workspace in addition to three mosaics that characterized the local bedrock and sand at "Roads End," "Knapsack Pass," and "Rae Lake." Mastcam also took a mosaic of "Round Lake" to image what is likely a small impact crater. We pushed the plan to the limit by including two long distance ChemCam RMI images of a dark band in the distance, and an outcrop along the upper Gediz Vallis Ridge to characterize the variety of rocks. Lastly, we included a Navcam mosaic of the view behind the rover to document several of the layers and buttes in Chenapau, Orinoco, and Kukenan that we drove by in recent months.
