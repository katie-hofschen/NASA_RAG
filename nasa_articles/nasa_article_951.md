Solar Secrets Unveiled: Planetarium Program Showcases Parker Solar Probe Discoveries 
 In January, the American Museum of Natural History (AMNH) hosted its monthly planetarium program, offering attendees an insightful journey into the study of our solar system's star. On January 23, 2024, Dr. Nour Raouafi, project scientist of the Parker Solar Probe and astrophysicist at the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory (APL), shared how the Parker Solar Probe is changing what we know about the Sun. Dr. Raouafi began by delving into the history of heliophysics, including Eugene N. Parker's groundbreaking predictions about solar wind. He then highlighted how recent results from the Parker Solar Probe play a crucial role in discovering significant space weather occurrences that can impact our life on Earth. The event attracted over 400 attendees, who were able to continue their learning with take-home materials, including an official paper craft model of the spacecraft.
