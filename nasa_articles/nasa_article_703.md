Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) Passes Mission Adoption 
 The first space-based observatory designed to detect gravitational waves has passed a major review and will proceed to the construction of flight hardware. On 1/25/24, ESA (European Space Agency), announced the formal adoption of LISA, the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna, to its mission lineup, with launch slated for the mid-2030s. ESA leads the mission, with NASA serving as a collaborative partner. Michael Katz (ST12) and Tyson Littenberg (ST12) support data science and astrophysics activities of the NASA LISA Study and lead research and development of critical data processing algorithms for the NASA LISA science ground segment.
