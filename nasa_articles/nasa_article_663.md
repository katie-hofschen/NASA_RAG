Paper Published Demonstrating the Power of X-ray Spectroscopy 
 A paper entitled “Can Emission Measure Distributions Derived from Extreme-ultraviolet Images Accurately Constrain High Temperature Plasma?” by P.S. Athiray and Amy Winebarger (ST13) has been published by the Astrophysical Journal on 1/25/24. This paper demonstrates the inability of EUV imagers to constrain high temperature plasma, while X-ray spectrographs, like the Marshall Grazing Incidence X-ray Spectrometer (MaGIXS), well constrain the high temperature plasma.
