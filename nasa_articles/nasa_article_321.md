Sols 4150-4151: The Little Rock That Moved… 
 On sol 4151, ChemCam starts off with observing a sand target called “Avalanche Lake,” and adding two long distance RMIs on the target area Kukenan. Mastcam again documents the ChemCam target and has an observation of their own with 28 frames looking at the target “Shepherd Creek.” But with no arm activities there is plenty of time for more atmospheric investigations, which include another dust devil movie, then looking at the horizon to check atmospheric dust levels, a cadence which is repeated three more times in the plan, taking full advantage of the power available to better understand the atmospheric changes. In addition, the DAN instrument observes the subsurface, and the weather station continues its cadence of measurements. And when we wake up in two days time here on Earth, we expect the rover to also have driven through another 15 or so meters across this challenging terrain, and hopefully it won’t be perched on a rock again... but... that’s offroad driving of the hardest kind, and we are safe, which is what matters most... and I can report that those of us lucky enough to be in the path of the solar eclipse also got to see it. It’s a practical demonstration of orbital mechanics, not to be missed!
