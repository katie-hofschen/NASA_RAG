Perseverance Pays off When Studying the Martian Atmosphere 
 Thirdly, when we expect to see something unusual based on the time of year or location, we increase the cadence of measurements to make sure we capture that event. In Perseverance’s first year on Mars we observed a scattering halo toward the end of Mars’s cloudy season. This bright ring around the Sun is caused by large hexagonal ice crystals that only form when lots of water vapor is present. Despite dozens of attempts to image another in the second Mars year, it wasn’t until our last attempt - right before the cloudy season ended - that we saw one (see figure)!
