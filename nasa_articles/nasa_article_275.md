Sols 4157-4158: What is That?? 
 Today’s planning was no different. “Typical” bedrock was captured in the DRT target, “Tioga Pass,” by MAHLI and APXS, and in multiple Mastcam and ChemCam RMI mosaics of both the bedrock along the trough surrounding the upper Gediz Vallis Ridge and the ridge itself. “Unusual” bedrock in the workspace was targeted by MAHLI, APXS, and ChemCam. MAHLI and APXS will work together on the “Wonder Lakes” target which had a much rougher, holey texture than typical bedrock, and MAHLI alone will image a block, “Peppermint Pass," whose red and white mottled color stood out. ChemCam targeted a separate rough-textured block with a darker-than-typical color at “The Hermit.” But the true eye-opener of the day was the target “Sawblade.” Sawblade is among the blocks visible along the top of the image above with the texture that was described by team members with terms like “wavy,” “tire tracks,” and “dragon scales.” We have seen a lot of layered rocks over the last 12 years on Mars, but these ones really stand out by the dizzying pattern they trace on the rock surfaces. ChemCam will check out the chemistry and texture of Sawblade and Mastcam will acquire a mosaic over this whole set of blocks so we can get a closer look at these wild new wonders.
