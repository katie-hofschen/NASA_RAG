Ingenuity Reestablishes Communications 
 On Saturday, Jan. 20, communications were reestablished between Ingenuity and NASAâ€™s Perseverance rover. The Ingenuity team has determined the helicopter is power-positive and is sitting vertically on the surface. Next steps include running further diagnostic checks, commanding Ingenuity to take photos of its location on the surface, and performing a spin test.
