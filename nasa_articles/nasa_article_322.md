Sols 4148-4149: A Mastcam MegaMosaic 
 Curiosity continues to drive south along the eastern margin of the upper Gediz Vallis ridge and will pause over the weekend for Mastcam to snap over 350 images that will be stitched together to create a beautiful 360-degree mosaic. Our current location along the rover’s traverse provides the optimal position for this postcard view because the rover is parked along a bend in the ridge between “Fascination Turret” and “Hinman Col” to the north, and “Pinnacle Ridge” to the south. The 360-degree mosaics are some of my favorite data products and this one will surely be a stunner!
