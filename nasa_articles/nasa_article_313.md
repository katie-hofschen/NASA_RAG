Seeing Totality 
 NASA/Keegan Barber

On April 8, 2024, a NASA photographer captured the total solar eclipse in Dallas. A small part of North America, from Mexicoâ€™s Pacific coast to the Atlantic coast of Newfoundland, Canada, saw the total solar eclipse, while all North America and parts of Central America and Europe saw a partial solar eclipse. The next total solar eclipse that will travel across the lower 48 states from coast to coast is in 2045.
