Eclipse Ambassadors off the Path: Reaching Underrepresented Audiences 
 Led by the Astronomical Society of the Pacific, this team partners with libraries, community centers, and more to match college undergraduate students and eclipse enthusiasts of all ages with amateur astronomers in order to train them to become Eclipse Ambassadors, who share the excitement of NASA solar science with their communities, in particular, traditionally underserved audiences. Eclipse Ambassadors represent a broad range of backgrounds from across 45 states, Washington D.C., Puerto Rico, and Guam, with native speakers of more than 40 languages. In addition to the formal training they receive, they participate in informal Social Hours to prepare them for engaging diverse audiences and receive an Eclipse Toolkit containing teaching materials and solar viewers to share with groups of 200 people â€“ half of which must come from underrepresented communities.
