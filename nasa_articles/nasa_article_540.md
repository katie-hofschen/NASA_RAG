On Feb. 23, NASA’s Glenn Research Center representatives were on hand to help celebrate the ribbon cutting and opening of Great Lakes Science Center’s Cleveland Creates Gallery. The gallery highlights the extraordinary breakthroughs being made by the city of Cleveland’s diverse industries.

During the opening, several hundred middle and high school students and museum visitors stopped by a NASA Glenn information table to learn more about NASA’s internship programs and the agency’s upcoming presence at the Total Eclipse Fest 2024, April 6–8.
