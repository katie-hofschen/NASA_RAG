Future of the NRP 
 The Next Generation Research Park

The planned NASA Research Park (NRP) is surrounded by innovative enterprises, including the world’s highest concentration of high tech companies, and many prestigious educational and research institutions. NASA Research Park is uniquely positioned to create a dynamic and successful environment for cutting edge research aligned with NASA’s future.



The NASA Ames Development Plan build-out includes 4.2 million square feet of office, research and development space, university classrooms, labs, museums, housing, and a conference and education center. Historic buildings will be renovated in NASA Research Park’s Shenandoah Plaza Historic District.



Most of the new construction at NASA Research Park will be south of the Historic District, requiring new roads and infrastructure. Residential units are planned in the Bay View parcel to mitigate increased traffic as required by the Environmental Impact Statement.



Traditional research parks transfer technology from the knowledge source to the external regional community. Aligning the reuse of Moffett Field with NASA’s future creates unique opportunities to promote scientific discovery and technological development through partnerships crucial to the exploration of space.
