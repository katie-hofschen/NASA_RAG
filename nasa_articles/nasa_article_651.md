Sols 4112-4113: In The Presence Of Royalty 
 Over the weekend Curiosity successfully drilled into ‘Mineral King!’ The drilling stopped a little short of the target depth, however we think there was enough sample to be sent for analysis. ‘Mineral King’ has now been analyzed within the CheMin instrument, and we are awaiting the results. After we see those results tomorrow morning, we will make the decision if we also want to analyze the sample with the Sample Analysis at Mars – SAM – instrument. The first sol of this two sol plan contains the preconditioning of SAM to optimistically get us ready to deliver the sample to SAM on Friday and, during this time, Curiosity stays put next to the drill hole, awaiting the results of analysis. This leaves plenty of time to take in the beautiful views of our kingdom.
