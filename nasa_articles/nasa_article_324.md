Eclipse Ambassadors Engage Communities Off the Path 
 Ambassadors worked mostly in local partnerships made up of a college student and an eclipse enthusiast. Together, they received training in the safety, science, and engagement techniques for sharing their passion with the public through the Astronomical Society of the Pacific. They then helped get the word out, along with safe solar viewing glasses and hands-on education materials, to more than 200,000 people total! Ambassadors drew from their diverse backgrounds, with native speakers of 40+ languages, and incorporated their passions such as flying, playing harp, and modeling into their public engagement efforts.
