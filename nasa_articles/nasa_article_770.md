ViewSpace: Did You Know? Videos for Learners 
 All three videos explore the process of science by adding in human elements and challenging viewer assumptions about what they are seeing. This exploration over the course of these less than two-minute-long videos is designed to encourage people who watch the videos to explore more through other resources from NASA’s Universe of Learning and other science materials. Links to related NASA’s Universe of Learning resources are provided to people who access the videos through ViewSpace.org in addition to the full extent of the ViewSpace Video Library and Interactives.
