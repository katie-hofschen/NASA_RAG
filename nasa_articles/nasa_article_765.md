Northern Maine Educators Prepare for Totality! 
 More than 70 teachers, librarians, and informal educators from Aroostook County, Maine gathered to exchange ideas and make plans in preparation for celebrating the upcoming total solar eclipse on April 8, 2024. Sponsored by the NASA Science Activation project Learning Ecosystems Northeast (LENE) and organized/hosted by Francis Malcolm Science Center (FMSC) in Easton, ME, these Trek to Totality events held on January 30 and February 13, 2024 included activity demonstrations by LENE partners, Gulf of Maine Research Institute and University of Maine Cooperative Extension 4H, as well as a variety of local educators, librarians, and organizations. The highlight of each evening was a planetarium show created and delivered by FMSC's Jim Stepp. Aroostook County, in the heart of rural Maine, is right in the path of totality, and this small but mighty all-volunteer science center has long served as a local leader both in science education as well as within the LENE network. With these events and others upcoming, Learning Ecosystems Northeast is making sure the northeast corner of NASA Science Activation stakeholders is ready for Totality!
