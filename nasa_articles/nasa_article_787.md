NASA Johnson Director to Discuss Exploration Park at ASCENDxTexas

Media are invited to attend an event with NASA taking place as part of ASCENDxTexas on Thursday, Feb. 15.

Vanessa Wyche, director of NASA’s Johnson Space Center in Houston, will be in attendance, as will Texas A&M University System Chancellor John Sharp and Texas A&M University President Mark Welsh. They will provide updates on Exploration Park and are available briefly for interviews after the announcement.

NASA sought proposals for use of the undeveloped and underutilized land near Saturn Lane, known as Exploration Park, on June 9, 2023. The parcel is outside of Johnson’s controlled access area and adjacent to its main campus.
