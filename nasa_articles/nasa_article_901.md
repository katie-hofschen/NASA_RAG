Sols 4082-4083: A New Perspective 
 As Deborah said on Friday, we’ve crossed the threshold into the time of year where we’ve seen global dust storms, the environmental theme group is keeping an eye on the dust situation. We have a few tools to help us with this — in today’s plan this includes a 360 degree dust devil survey, two line-of-sight observations looking at the amount of dust in the crater, and a tau looking at the total amount of dust in the atmospheric column. We’re also getting a suprahorizon movie, which is normally used for clouds but has been known to catch dust movement too.
