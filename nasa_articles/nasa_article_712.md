Eclipse Resources for Learners and Educators: Connecting the Eclipse to Astrophysics 
 In anticipation of the upcoming total solar eclipse on April 8, 2024, NASA's Universe of Learning has created a webpage of astrophysics-related eclipse resources for learners and educators. The webpage shares information about two topics that align with eclipse science: gravitational lensing and exoplanet transits. The collection of resources includes articles, images, and videos to understand and explain the science. Additional activities allow learners to explore gravitational lensing and exoplanet transit science for themselves.
