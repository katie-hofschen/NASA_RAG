Sols 4086-4088: Groundhog Day in Gale 
 On the third sol, we drive away and attempt to take a full look at the wheels with MAHLI, Navcam, and Mastcam Right. We do this every kilometer or so to keep track of wheel integrity. The rover will drive a small amount and take images a total of five times, until all sides of the wheels have been imaged. MARDI takes advantage of wheel imaging by taking a single MARDI image at each wheel imaging stop, for extra ground coverage. After the wheel imaging we’ll continue to our end-of-drive destination and take the post-drive imaging needed for Monday’s plan. It doesn’t sound like a lot when I type it out, and I intentionally left out some smaller activities in the plan, but believe me when I say everyone on the team was working hard today! I hope our rover isn’t a fan of Groundhog Day so it doesn’t have to be planned again.
