New Year, New Images from Mars! 
 Since parking at Airey Hill during Solar Conjunction back in November, Perseverance has been busy exploring. We drove north from Airey Hill to Flat Point, where we had the best views to conduct imaging using Mastcam-Z of some of the deepest parts of the Margin Unit. We then drove south-east, parallel to a ridge that shows apparent layering, and imaged targets including Burnt Island and Lily Bay. It was then time to wrap up our excursion into the area known as Gnaraloo Bay, pass through Jurabi Point once more, and continue east across the Margin Unit. Our next goal is to reach an area called Beehive Geyser, which is on the eastern side of the Margin Unit and adjacent to the Neretva Vallis channel. If you want to keep up to date with where Perseverance is driving, you can see the roverâ€™s traverse and current location on this interactive map.
