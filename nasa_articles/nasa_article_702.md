Hinode Attitude and Control System (AOCS) Maintenance Operation 
 On 12/20/23, the Japanese Aerospace Agency (JAXA) conducted a series of special operations that reset the rotation speed of the Hinode momentum wheel (MW). The primary purpose of this exercise was to reduce/dampen disturbances to the Solar Optical Telescope focal plane images. This same MW maintenance operation was last performed in February 2023. The three Hinode telescopes were all put into safe mode and no observations took place between 6:00UT on 12/20 thru 9:00UT on 02/22. As a precaution, several contact windows were scheduled to support this AOCS adjustment, which JAXA has now verified to have been fully successful.
