Sols 4076–4077: Driving Into Springtime 
 Both science theme groups made good use of the favourable power situation, fitting in just about three hours of activities between the two sols we planned today. We begin with an early-morning investigation of the target "Manzanita," first using DRT to clear away the ubiquitous Martian dust before placing APXS atop it. With the arm pulled away from Manzanita, we move on to ChemCam, beginning with LIBS on "University Peak." ChemCam RMI will then take a mosaic of a region of Kukenán (the large butte that forms the eastern wall of Gediz Vallis) south of where the rover is currently parked. Once ChemCam has finished its work, it's Mastcam's time to shine, starting with a set of images to document the results of the University Peak LIBS activity. Mastcam will then take a look off in the direction that we plan to drive, and finish off by documenting some sedimentary layers at "Trail Crest" and searching for polygonal fracturing at "Atwell Grove." Before driving away from this location, we get up close and personal with Manzanita one more time, brushing it again with DRT and imaging it with MAHLI.
