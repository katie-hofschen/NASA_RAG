Sols 4154-4156: Bumpy Driving up the Mountain 
 Although we didn't make it to our intended location at the edge of the channel, this weekend's plan is still packed full of science. We start off with a hefty two hours of activities, starting off with a ChemCam LIBS of the bedrock target "Kaweah River." ChemCam RMI will then take a 10x1 mosaic of Fascination Turret, which has featured in many mission update posts over the last few weeks. After ChemCam finishes its work for this first sol, we have a full hour of Mastcam imaging. This hour begins with documentation images of the LIBS target, then continues with a 6x4 mosaic of the area we will be driving towards. We'll then take some pictures of "Goodale Mountain," a vertically-oriented fractured bedrock block about 6.5 metres from our current location. Our big Mastcam activity for this plan is a 22x3 mosaic of a bedrock trough that can be seen in orbital imagery. Mastcam finishes off its first sol with a mosaic of some rocks off to the right side of the rover. These two hours wrap up with a Navcam suprahorizon movie to observe dust and cloud activity over Gale, as well as a Navcam line-of-sight to measure the amount of dust in the crater.
