Sols 4146-4147: Looking back at Hinman Col 
 Today we planned a Touch and Go plan. Our workspace had abundant large, stable blocks – not always a given! - which made for a relatively easy planning process for the geology and mineralogy theme group (GEO). The bedrock here is predominantly a pale coloured rock, massive (non-lineated) in appearance, but there are rare fragments of darker layers in places, which look more like the dark layered rocks back at “Mineral King,” our last drill site. We will brush the dominant lithology at “Ruby Creek” and use APXS and MAHLI on this target. We will also get ChemCam LIBS and a Mastcam image of a small patch of the darker layer at “Tuttle Obelisk” which will allow us to compare the chemical composition of both the dominant paler bedrock and the rarer fragments of dark material.
