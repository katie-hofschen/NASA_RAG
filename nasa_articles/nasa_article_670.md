Holiday Blues and SAD: Discussion 
 The winter months provide some of the biggest challenges to wellness during the year. The stress of the holidays, the pressure of the new year, and the risk of Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD) take a toll and can become problematic if we do not care for ourselves.
