Maine Educators Re-Energized After Gathering 
 On February 28-29, 2024, 57 teachers, librarians, and out-of-school educators gathered for a two-day retreat organized and supported by members of the NASA Science Activation Programâ€™s Learning Ecosystems Northeast project team. Based at the Gulf of Maine Research Institute (GMRI), Learning Ecosystems Northeast (LENE) supports regional peer communities of educators who are working to co-develop data-rich climate learning experiences that span learning contexts. This high-energy leap-day retreat was held on the campus of the University of Maine Orono (a project partner) and featured a balance of hands-on activities that educators can use in their learning contexts; reflection time to support educators to absorb and activate their learning; and collaborative planning time to design cross-context learning opportunities for youth.
