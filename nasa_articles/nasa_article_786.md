Beehive Geyser Beckons 
 Perseverance continues its uphill march through the tricky terrain of the margin unit, an area with enhanced signals of carbonate. We are headed toward a region we’ve nicknamed “Beehive Geyser,” an area about 500 m to the west. What draws us here? Well, this region lies approximately 60 m above the part of the margin unit that we encountered and sampled for the first time last September. By comparing the rock’s characteristics at this higher interval with what we’ve already seen, we hope to uncover clues about the emplacement and history of the unit.
