Infiniscope and Eclipse Soundscapes Collaboration Reaches 1,766 Middle School Students 
 Tonia Kirby, science teacher at the RISE Academy in Rantoul, Illinois, said, “As a brand new alternative middle school, we are focusing on giving our students real-world experiences. This is a great opportunity for our kids to see science in real time and be a part of it. I am very excited to take all of our students outside on Monday and observe the world around us.” And eight grade science teacher, Alison Zemba, at Pittsburgh Classical Academy, expressed excitement for the opportunity afforded to her students through the ASU-NASA partnership: “I have been implementing Infiniscope’s Kingdom of Peril lessons, and my students have been loving it. " She added, "They have had 'aha' moments and have been able to incorporate technology into learning about the Sun/Earth/Moon system.”
