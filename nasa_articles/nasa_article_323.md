NASA SCoPE Supports Science Activation Projects and Events for 2024 Eclipse 
 Additionally, SCoPE supported the Eclipse Soundscapes (ES) program – a NASA Citizen Science initiative based at Advanced Research in Inclusion & STEAM Accessibility (ARISA) Lab – with two SMEs, namely Dr. Valerie Johnson from Shaw University and Dr. Lindsay Fuller from the University of Texas - Austin. Their contributions ensured the strategic placement of AudioMoth devices in 19 locations along the eclipse's path of totality to capture sounds during the eclipse. Dr. Johnson focused on involving faculty and students from six Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs), exemplifying inclusivity and broadened participation in NASA science. Dr. Fuller's efforts aimed to expand the ES project in Texas, particularly in Austin, through collaborations with 13 local educational institutions, parks, and community organizations. In addition to recruiting and guiding ES Data Collectors, they also promoted and encouraged people to participate as ES Observers on eclipse day, further supporting NASA Citizen Science.
