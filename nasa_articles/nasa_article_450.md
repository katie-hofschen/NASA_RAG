Sols 4134-4135: Sun Blob Blues 
 Sometimes it feels like we all make up the same brain and planning goes smooth as silk. Today I'm thankful it felt like that, because Friday plans have a higher potential to get rough. It really helps when the morning downlink brings down more data than expected and shows our drive completing successfully! The only thing getting us down was the “sun blob,” a 13 degree cone around the sun that ChemCam is not allowed to point within. If ChemCam is pointed at the sun while not in a safe focus setting, its optics or RMI detector could be damaged. The sun blob includes the sun’s entire daily path through the sky plus 13 degrees, in the event ChemCam gets stuck pointed somewhere and Earth is unable to respond in time. Unfortunately, the ChemCam RMI areas of interest these days are mostly all inside the sun blob, and it’s slowly moving southwards just like us! So while on Wednesday our rover was singing Back to the uGVr, today she’s singing the “Sun Blob Blues” by the Channel Surfers (not a real band). Some of the team even thinks the blob itself might be sentient and hunting us (not really).
