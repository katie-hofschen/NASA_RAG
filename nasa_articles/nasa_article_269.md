My NASA Data Milestones: Eclipsed by the Eclipse! 
 Having recently celebrated over 1 million digital engagements in the 2023 fiscal year, MND was excited and amazed to experience a record-breaking 1 million visitors from March 10 - April 10, 2024 -– a single month! – due to interest in the April 8, 2024 total solar eclipse, with increased traffic from states within the path of totality. Visitors to the website used search terms: eclipse, solar eclipse, and what is a solar eclipse. Web metrics show that visitors most frequently viewed lesson plans and what MND calls "mini-lessons", and the majority of views were from users in Texas, New York, and Illinois.
