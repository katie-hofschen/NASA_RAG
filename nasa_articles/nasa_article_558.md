Sols 4123-4124: Third Time’s the Charm! 
 Today, we are planning for another checkout on our third “Mineral King” target on Sol 4123. We’re really excited about the potential science value from this area, so we are willing to try again to get more sample. Recall that for our first “Mineral King” target, while we were able to successfully drill, we did not get our normal amount of powder sample to do all of the science analysis we wanted to, hence the additional drilling. We’ll be able to assess on Wednesday whether our third checkout passes our engineering criteria to proceed with a full drill. In addition to the preload checkout, we have a Sol 4123 environmental science block with Navcam measurements to determine scatterings of atmospheric aerosols, take a cloud movie, and search for dust devils. We will also take Mastcam measurements to measure optical depth.
