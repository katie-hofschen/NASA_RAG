NASA to Launch Sounding Rockets into Moonâ€™s Shadow During Solar Eclipse 
 UPDATE: The three rockets comprising the APEP mission launched on Monday, April 8, 2024, at 2:40pm, 3:25pm, and 4:28pm ET from NASA's Wallops Flight Facility in Virginia. The rockets reached altitudes of 254 miles, 255 miles, and 256 miles (410 kilometers, 411 kilometers, and 413 kilometers), respectively. The PI reports the second and third rockets were launched farther apart to ensure the best pre- and -post peak eclipse conditions were captured and that every science instrument on the three main payloads and 12 ejected sub payloads successfully took measurements. This article was also updated to correct that the previous sounding rockets were launched and recovered from White Sands Test Facility to White Sands Missile Range.
