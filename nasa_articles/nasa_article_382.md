Unlocking the Martian Skies – Using Ingenuity as a Martian Testbed for Future Rotorcraft 
 The reason that these flights are so significant is because they provide key fundamental validation of rotorcraft models and methods which would otherwise require conditions that are impossible to replicate here on Earth. As explained by Tove Aagren, lead simulator at Ames and designer of the Sys-ID campaign, “An inherent challenge of working with Mars rotorcraft is that of model validation. Extraterrestrial flight necessitates high confidence in our prediction models, yet replicating the true flight condition to gain this confidence across an entire flight envelope in Earth-based testing is highly non-trivial. To this day, aspects of forward flight dynamics of Ingenuity remain associated with uncertainty. This is what makes the opportunity to characterize key vehicle dynamics in the true operating condition, i.e. on Mars, incredibly exciting. Not only for the novelty of the approach, but for the fundamental insights that we really cannot gain in any other way than through designated system identification flights.”
