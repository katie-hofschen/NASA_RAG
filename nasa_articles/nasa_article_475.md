Sols 4132-4133: Back to the u.G.V.R. 
 If the Curiosity rover had a song stuck in her head today, she might be humming “Back to the uGVR,” to the tune of The Beatles “Back in the U.S.S.R,” as she drives south along the eastern edge of the upper Gediz Vallis Ridge (uGVR). The rover drove up to the uGVR last summer and investigated several rocks; now with the beautiful “Fascination Turret” section of the uGVR in sight, the team is very excited to have another opportunity to further characterize the material within the ridge and assess the nature of its contact with the underlying Mt. Sharp bedrock.
