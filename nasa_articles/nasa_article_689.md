Marshall Scientists Participate in the 243rd Meeting of the American Astronomical Society in New Orleans, LA 
 Multiple Marshall Space Flight Center Astrophysics scientists participated in the 243rd meeting of the American Astronomical Society.

Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE) Project Scientist, Steven Ehlert (ST12), gave a NASA Hyperwall presentation summarizing IXPE science results obtained thus far and, as Chandra Deputy Project Scientist, he also presented summarizing observations of the Perseus Cluster during 25 years of Chandra science on the Hyperwall.

IXPE team member, Mary Lynn (Lynnie) Saade (ST12) presented “A First Look at the X-ray Polarization of 4U 1624-49 with IXPE.”

Peter Maksym chaired the session “AGN IV” at the meeting. Session presentations included multiple promising new X-ray and multiwavelength studies of obscured active galactic nuclei, as well as a combined Hubble and Chandra study of the proper motion of a knot in the jet emitted by the active galactic nucleus in the galaxy M87.

Fermi-GBM team members Corinne Fletcher (USRA) and Sarah Dalessi (UAH) presented two noteworthy gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) at the 243rd meeting of the American Astronomical Society in New Orleans: the ultra-long GRB 220627A with multiple emission episodes spanning across 1000 seconds, and GRB 230307A the second brightest GRB observed in over 50 years. Fermi-GBM team members from Astrophysics Branch also staffed the NASA’s High Energy Observatories booth.

Finally, Members of the Astrophysics Branch, including Steven Ehlert, Michelle Hui, Peter Maksym, Michael Katz, Lynnie Saade, Chien-Ting Chien, and Debra Wallace supported IXPE and Chandra outreach at the MSFC Astrophysics Booth at the meeting.
