Applications Now Open to Request Location-Specific Data from GLOBE Observer 
 The feature was tested in 2023 during the NASA Moon Tree Quest, in which a team of scientists and educators from NASA and the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Forest Service asked volunteers to find the surviving Apollo Moon Trees and measure their height. The app alerted volunteers when they were within about 25 kilometers of a known Moon Tree with the location of the tree and a request to measure it. Other early test projects asked volunteers to document ice in a river basin in Alaska and to map land cover on a university campus – both with the app’s Land Cover tool.
